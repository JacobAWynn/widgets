# Widgets folder

This folder contains different widgets that I personally may use on a daily basis. You are free to create your own widgets using Python and the tkinter / ttk library.

# How to use

## Windows

Create a shortcut for the .bat file, copy it, open the "Execute" menu with Win + R, type "shell:startup", hit Enter and paste the file.

## Linux

It don't even work in Linux; I'll get around to fixing it *later...*
