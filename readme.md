# Widgets folder

This folder contains different widgets that I personally may use on a daily basis. You are free to create your own widgets using Python and the ttkbootstrap library.

# How to use

If you don't have ttkbootstrap installed, what are you doing?

If you do, however, you must create a shortcut for each widget and paste it in the startup folder using Win + R and the "shell:startup" command.
